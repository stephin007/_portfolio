        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hey, people!</p>
        <p>I believe you know that I am fond of clicking random pictures and travel to places that can make anyone's heart beat a
        little faster.</p>
        <p>This is how I am and all this fondness for capturing pictures of things or people or even a situation was gifted to me
        while I was still a kid.
        Then I realised, I grew with a longing which isn't for a person or a thing. It's something far
        more than that and I found that this craving can be satisfied by photography.  </p>
        <p>Photography was my hobby, even when I was a kid I was fascinated by the pictures that I would come across over the
        internet or books or even newspapers.As I grew up, this hobby grew bigger and consumed more and more of me.I became the guy who was never found in the group photo because being out of the frame was something I loved.</p>
        <p>I always tried to put my perspective into a picture, to show the world a different way of looking at things. So I
        decided to turn this hobby into my passion as I wanted to do something in this field.</p>
        <p>But I needed a platform, a place where I could potray myself through my work.</p>
        <br>

        <p>And I found a perfect way to do that. So, presenting this page to you all. It contains my experience, my perspective of
        this world. Hope you guys love it. And would always love to hear your views.</p>

              <p>This picture captures the true essence of life around us, raw, pure and almost scenic; with each man fending for
              himself, trying to feed his family. Just as the fisherman here, trying to make the most out of what he has.</p>

              the Amazon, it is a woman- all encompassing, never ending, grace and poise of a woman.</p>

              <p>Sometimes, a mirror captures more than what meets the eye. This day, the photographer could capture the solitude in

              <p>It is almost surreal how the littlest of things in life can capture our attention for much longer than we anticipate
